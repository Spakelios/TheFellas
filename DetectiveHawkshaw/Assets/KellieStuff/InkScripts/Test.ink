"Mam! I may have crafted the most unsolvable mystery for you yet!"

{Name("Leila")}

Enthusiastic as always and grinning from ear to ear. 
Katya snuggles up beside me attempting to commandeer my office chair. 
I make some space and pat her head as she slaps her notebook onto the table.

{Name("Katya")}

"You ready? I bet even Mama would have a hard time with this one!"

"oh? even something your mama couldn't solve? then it really must be impossible"

I try not to sound too sarcastic with that one. 
My issues with Svetlana was something not for the ears of our daughter. 
I clear my throat and regain myself as she opens the notebook. 

{Name("Katya")}
{Icon("LeilaHappy")}

"Lets start with your Brief!"

    -> END
